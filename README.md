This analysis evaluates the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting loan risk. It classifies loans as either 0 or 1 as healthy or high-risk respectively. 
Accurate high-risk loan prediction is needed for managing financial risk. 
The functions and metrics used in this process id for determining the model's effectiveness.

**Performance Metrics**
Accuracy: 0.9924

Precision:
Healthy Loans (0): 1.00
High-Risk Loans (1): 0.87

Recall:
Healthy Loans (0): 1.00
High-Risk Loans (1): 0.89

**Recommendation**
The logistic regression model is highly accurate (99.24%) and performs almost perfectly in predicting healthy loans. 
It also performs well for high-risk loans, with precision at 0.87 and recall at 0.89, indicating some false positives and negatives but still effectively identifying most high-risk loans. 
Based on these results, I recommend using this model for predicting loan risk.
